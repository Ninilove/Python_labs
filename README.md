Hi there,

The following codes are some mini projects I've been working on, you can see the output directly on the pdf file attached to this repository, or just copy the code in each repo and test it yourself. 
The first mini project goal is to diplay a message on a banner using some Python concatenation methods; I chose the string escape character, mainly with the tab option to create the space in between the characters. 
The second mini project consisted of using 3 variables with strings and interger to display a message using the format() method. 
The third mini project consisted of using 2 variables with strings and floating point to display a message using the f-string. 


Happy coding!!!
